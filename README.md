Portfolio Site
Welcome to my portfolio site, created using React, React Router DOM, and Bootstrap. This site has four sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact.

Key Features
Dark Mode
This site includes a dark mode option, which can be toggled on and off using the toggle button in the top right corner of the screen. This feature makes the site easier to view in low-light environments and can help reduce eye strain.

Tooltips
Tooltips have been added throughout the site to provide additional information and context for various elements. Simply hover over an item to see its tooltip.

Responsive Design
This site is designed to be fully responsive, meaning it will adjust to fit the screen size of any device it is viewed on. Whether you're viewing on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone, the site will look great and be easy to navigate.
